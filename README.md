Project Title: Analysis of Google Play Store Data for Insights into App Success and User Sentiment
Project Overview:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of Google Play Store data to understand factors contributing to app success and popularity, with a focus on user sentiment. The dataset included information about app categories, user ratings, number of installs, app sizes, price, and user reviews. The goal was to uncover trends and patterns that could inform app developers and stakeholders about user preferences and market demands.
Data Processing and Cleaning:
The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types. For example, columns containing ratings and reviews were adjusted to ensure numeric consistency, and free vs. paid apps were categorized to compare their performance
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA provided insights into distribution patterns, most popular app categories, and average ratings across different categories. Visualizations, including bar charts and histograms, were generated to highlight trends such as which app categories dominate the store in terms of downloads, average ratings, and paid versus free app performance.
Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews:
A sentiment analysis was performed on user reviews to identify overall user satisfaction and dissatisfaction trends. Sentiment scores were derived using NLP techniques to classify reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments, providing a more nuanced view of user preferences and recurring issues.
Key Findings and Insights:
The analysis revealed that certain categories like "Education" and "Entertainment" have higher ratings, while free apps tend to have significantly more downloads than paid ones. User sentiment analysis also highlighted common grievances and areas for improvement, such as app performance and user experience.
Tools and Technologies:
The project utilized Python, Pandas, Plotly for data visualization, and NLP libraries for sentiment analysis. This analysis equipped stakeholders with data-backed recommendations to improve app features and optimize app store listings.
